1. What is an element in an array or list?
Elements are individual values of data that are grouped in arrays, dictionaries, and lists. 

2. What is the index number of the first element in an array or list?
The index number of the first element in an array or list is zero (zero-indexed).

3. Can a single array or list store different types of data?
No, a single array or list can not contain different types of data, as when you define the list you declare an element type, limiting the element data to only one type.

4. How can you add more elements to an array to make room for more data?
You can not add more elements to an array after it is initially defined; you would have to use a list instead if you wanted to add more elements as they are flexible and can be modified.

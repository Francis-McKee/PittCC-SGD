# PittCC-SGD
Simulation and Game Design Programming Certificate

This is a repo for the files from my classes for the SGD Programming certificate at Pitt Community College, located in Winterville, NC. I also added other classes that I chose to take that did not count for the certificate. I figured it would be a good thing to create so that job recruiters/ hiring managers could see exactly what was taught and what I learned at PittCC. Unfortunately I only thought of creating this repo after taking the first semester of classes for the two certificates, but I did my best to add as many files as I still had saved on my personal computer for each class. I also listed the classes in the specific order that I took them because many were prerequisites and needed to be taken in this order.

## Class List

### First Semester
1. SGD-116: [Graphic Design Tools](https://github.com/Francis-McKee/PittCC-SGD/tree/main/Graphic%20Design%20Tools)
* COURSE DESCRIPTION: This course introduces students to computer-based graphic design tools and their use within the context of simulation and game design. Topics include texture creation, map creation, and introduction to advanced level graphic design techniques. Upon completion, students should be able to competently use and explain industry-standard graphic design software.
* TEXTBOOK: Adobe Photoshop CC: Classroom in a Book (2019 Release), Andrew Faulkner & Conrad Chavez

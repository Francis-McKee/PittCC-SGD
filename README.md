# PittCC-SGD
Simulation and Game Design Programming and Art Certificates

This is a repo for the files from my classes for the SGD Programming and SGD Art certificates (2) at Pitt Community College, located in Winterville, NC. I figured it would be a good thing to create so that job recruiters/ hiring managers could see exactly what was taught and what I learned at PittCC. Unfortunately I only thought of creating this repo after taking the first semester of classes for the two certificates, but I did my best to add as many files as I still had access to for each class.

## Class List

1. SGD-116: Graphic Design Tools. 
  * Textbook - Adobe Photoshop CC: Classroom in a Book 2019 Release
2. CSC-118: Swift Programming I
